            <h2>Hindrances that May Occur</h2>
            <p>
                One possible hindrance is balancing academic requirements with other personal or professional responsibilities. The fast-paced evolution of web technologies may also require continuous self-study to keep up. Limited time for hands-on practice during peak academic periods could affect my learning progress. However, I plan to manage these challenges through proper time management and consistent effort.
